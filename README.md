## The purpose of this repository is to help guide us through gitHub and become familair with it
## Github is a useful tool to store code


# **Assesment Questions**
###.  1. Git is used in vs code to help push infomration onto github from vs code, it is a source tool developers use, on the other hadn github is an online website used to store code
###. 2. A repository is used to store code online, three essential componets in a repository are readme file, programming file, and commits history.
###.  3. Forks helps you create  aversion of a github reposipry that is your own, on the other hand Clones can still make chnages to the orginal repository with permission. Use a Fork when you are making your own project and not the same one as the original repository. 
###. 4. First you create a branch in your repository, and make all neccessary changes such as creating new files, editing files, renaming and such. The deafault branch is not being affected, until its merged. Commit and push chnages with a descriptive message. Once all chnages are made, a pull request can be sent so that the branches can be merged together 
###. 5. The purpose of the pull request is to merge your changes of your clone branch onto the original branch. All changes need to be specific, and the organization or owner needs to approve of the pull request. 
###. 6. Issues contribute to project managament because they can keep track of bug reports, new features and ideas, or any notes of the project that need to be recorded.
###. 7. A good commit message will help you or others understand the changes in the code, or go back to chnage thing si neccessary as all your commit chnages are saved. A good commit message decribes the specfiifc chnages that were made in the file, captilizing the first letter in the subject line. An exmaple is " New varibles names of the drive train were added, they are currently not being used, only initialized. 
###. 8. Branches help in the development process because they help you orgnize your code and test new programs out without changeing the original. Using branches it is easier to make chnages and can see commit version history more clearly, at the same time other people could wokr on thier own individual branches, to test out more code and ideas.
###. 9. A Readme is important because they help to describe what your repository is and what programs it has. A good ReadMe file has to have a project title, descrption and a table of contents to guide people through your repository. 
###. 10. I can engage in the github community by becoming more active and exploring other repository to learn new code. I will also look through forums/issues in projects I will need in the future. They will all help me learn code better and manage github more effectively while using VS Code at the same time.
